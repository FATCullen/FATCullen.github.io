  <h2>
    Sections
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are four main sections to this website, each of which can be accessed through the menu at the top of the page.  
    If you're new to the game, I would recommend going through them in order, but if theres a specific area of your game you're looking to improve you can look at any section.
    The four sections are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Rules: </b>
    This section teaches the basic rules of the game, from the board setup to the moves of each of the pieces, as well as the objective of the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Opening: </b>
    This section teaches about the opening, which is the first five to ten moves of the game, and shows some opening traps.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Midgame: </b>
    This section teaches about the midgame, which is the majority of most games.  It shows various tactics and attacks, as well as things to watch out for.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Endgame: </b>
    This section teaches about the endgame, the section after the majority of the major pieces  are gone.  It shows endgame tactics, as well as various types of checkmates.
